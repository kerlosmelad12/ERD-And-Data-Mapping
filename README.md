# ERD-And-Data-Mapping

This repository contains several database design cases with their **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagrams)** and **Mapping**.  
The ERD shows the **entities, attributes, and relationships**, while the mapping explains how these are implemented in a relational schema (tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships).
